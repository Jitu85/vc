# Project Progress Log

## Current Status

- Project folder: `C:\Users\HP\Documents\GitHub\Digitally Virtual\Codex_Version`
- Workspace checked and found to be empty at the start of this log.
- The user wants the work and our conversation history recorded in markdown inside this folder.

## What We Know So Far

- The build is based on two markdown specification files and three Word documents containing the source content.
- The user is not satisfied with a previous build attempt.
- Missing answers should be filled in correctly.
- Some source material should be excluded, such as copyright notes, prefaces, and advice text that is not needed in the final app.
- The user permits us to use judgment to improve formatting, answer quality, and overall presentation.

## Conversation Summary

1. The user asked for the project folder name.
2. The project folder was identified as `Codex_Version`.
3. The user then asked to keep markdown notes of our progress and conversations inside this folder.

## Working Notes

- This file will be used as the running progress record for the project.
- Future updates can be appended here with dates, decisions, blockers, and completed work.

## Next Steps

- Continue extracting and organizing the source material.
- Keep app-building notes here as the implementation progresses.
- Add dated entries whenever an important decision or milestone is reached.

## 2026-06-29 — Volume I Extraction Resumed

- Re-read both governing specification files and confirmed the required staged delivery: extract, audit, and build Volume I before unlocking Volumes II and III.
- Confirmed all three source Word files are readable, while deliberately ignoring unrelated files in both source locations.
- Added a reusable XML-based DOCX extractor that preserves document order, list flags, bold, italic, underline, and the author's red-highlight formatting.
- Extracted Volume I into `data/raw/volume-1.json`: 2,174 ordered elements and 12 chapter boundaries were detected.
- Added an initial structuring/audit pass and generated `data/reports/volume-1-audit.md`.
- Confirmed the source contains irregular layouts that require correction beyond automatic parsing: packed numbered answers, worked examples embedded inside exercise lists, sentence pairs split across list/plain paragraphs, and special handling for Chapters 10–12.
- Current work: resolving every item/answer mismatch and generating correct answers where the original book omits them, as explicitly requested by the user.

## 2026-06-30 — Volume I Approved; Phase II Started

- The user tested the Volume I application and approved proceeding to the next phase.
- Volume I delivered 12 chapters, 27 exercises, and 674 interactive questions with no blank answers.
- Phase II scope: formatting-aware extraction and audit of Volume II, repair of missing/incorrect answers, application integration, and unlocking Volume II.
- Volume III remains locked pending approval of Volume II.

## 2026-06-30 — Phase II / Volume II Completed

- Extracted Volume II from Word XML: 2,961 ordered elements and 9 chapter boundaries.
- Reconstructed 18 exercises containing 908 interactive questions.
- Verified that every Volume II question has an answer; zero blank answers remain.
- Corrected confirmed answer-key/extraction defects, including the split “5-30 train” answer, narrative text misread as answers, corrupted Exercise 14 answer rows, and an “End of Part” print artifact.
- Unlocked Volume II in Page A; Volume III remains pending review.
- Migrated progress storage so Volume I and Volume II chapter/quiz progress remain independent while preserving existing Volume I progress.
- Added per-volume lazy loading: Page A now loads a 66.46 KB gzip application script; Volume I and Volume II content load only when opened.
- TypeScript check and production build pass.
- Browser QA passed on desktop and mobile: Volume II index, chapter navigation, quiz entry, correct-answer checking, answer reveal, progress controls, breadcrumb, and console health.
- Final Browser-plugin limitation: the in-app Browser runtime path was unavailable, so the documented Playwright fallback used installed Chrome. No application console errors remained.

## 2026-07-01 — Volume III and Full Application Completed

- Extracted and finalized all 12 Volume III chapters.
- Reconstructed 28 exercises containing 1,031 interactive questions; every question has an answer and zero blanks remain.
- Restored the omitted Exercise 10 in Reported Speech and repaired irregular tables, paired prompts, word-formation grids, phrase/clause exercises, and answer-key alignment.
- Added generated model responses for paragraph writing, reading comprehension, story writing, and letter writing where the source book supplied no answers.
- Preserved the original instructional sentence-classification diagram from the Word document and placed it in context in Chapter 8; regeneration was unnecessary because the source image is clear and accurate.
- Unlocked Volume III on Page A and added lazy loading for its content bundle.
- Added responsive lesson-image rendering and fixed a mobile chapter-rail overflow.
- Final totals: 33 chapters, 73 exercises, and 2,613 questions across all three volumes, with zero missing answers.
- TypeScript and production build pass.
- Rendered QA passed on desktop and mobile: Volume III index, chapter navigation, diagram rendering, quiz entry, answer reveal, responsive layout, and console health.
- The in-app Browser could not attach to its webview, so the documented Playwright fallback used installed Chrome. No application console or page errors remained.

### Completion-status correction

- The entry above completed the three-volume grammar module, not the entire Virtual Classroom specification.
- The broader application still requires its public/authentication/content-hub/admin pages. Future entries will distinguish a completed page or module from completion of the full specification.

## 2026-07-01 — Public Landing Page Completed

- Added the public `Virtual Classroom` landing page at `#/`.
- Moved the grammar Page A index to `#/grammar`.
- Added an accessible three-image carousel with automatic rotation, previous/next controls, direct slide controls, and pause/play.
- Added Login, Sign-Up, Continue as Guest, and Admin Login actions. Guest access is functional and opens Page A; the other actions display an explicit next-phase notice until their pages are built.
- Corrected navigation: chapter and quiz pages return to Page A; Page A returns to the Virtual Classroom landing page.
- Added three optimized WebP carousel illustrations totaling approximately 645 KB and saved the approved concept under `design/concepts/landing-page-reference.png`.
- Production build passes. Desktop and mobile regression passed with no console/page errors and no mobile horizontal overflow.
- Full tested path: landing ? Guest ? Page A ? Volume III chapter ? Back to Page A ? Back to Virtual Classroom.
- Remaining specification work: registration, returning-user login, guest-session handling, admin login, post-login content hub, module placeholders, and admin dashboard/backend services.

## 2026-07-01 — Admin Login and Dashboard Frontend Completed

- Added a dedicated Administrator Access route at `#/admin-login` and protected dashboard route at `#/admin`.
- Added demo-only administrator authentication using session storage, with an explicit warning that production authentication still requires a secure backend.
- Added a route guard and functional sign-out.
- Built the administration dashboard with student search, verification-status filtering, summary figures, guest-access control, content-module add/edit/remove actions, sidebar selection, and usage indicators.
- Connected the Guest Login feature flag to the public landing page.
- Saved accepted visual references under `design/concepts/admin-login-reference.png` and `design/concepts/admin-dashboard-reference.png`.
- Production build passes.
- Desktop/mobile QA passed: route guard, demo login, filtering, guest toggle, module addition, sign-out, console health, and mobile overflow.
- This milestone completes the admin frontend/demo workflow only. Production administration remains incomplete until server-side authentication, authorization, persistent database storage, audit logging, CSRF protection, rate limiting, and secure session management are implemented.

## 2026-07-01 — Student Login Frontend Completed

- Added the student login route at `#/login` and connected the Landing Page Login action.
- Added validated email/password fields, password visibility control, forgot-password status feedback, demo-account autofill, session state, and public-site return.
- Successful demo login currently enters Page A; this destination will move to the Student Content Hub when that next milestone is completed.
- Saved the accepted visual reference at `design/concepts/student-login-reference.png`.
- Production build passes.
- Desktop/mobile QA passed: landing navigation, recovery feedback, password visibility, demo login, grammar entry, console health, and mobile overflow.
- This milestone completes only the Student Login frontend/demo workflow. Secure login remains dependent on the backend authentication phase.

## 2026-07-01 — Registration and OTP Frontend Completed

- Added `#/register` and connected Sign-Up from the landing page and Create Account from Student Login.
- Implemented Full Name, Age, Class/Grade, School, Email, Password, Confirm Password, Phone Number, and a 197-option country selector.
- Added validation for ages 4–18, email, password length/matching, phone format, required fields, and parental/guardian consent.
- Added the local Secret Code demonstration flow: request code, incorrect-code response, correct-code verification, and account-creation gating.
- The demo code is `246810`; production email delivery remains explicitly deferred to the secure backend phase.
- Successful registration creates local demo profile/session state and currently enters Page A; this destination will move to the Student Content Hub in the next milestone.
- Saved the accepted reference at `design/concepts/student-registration-reference.png`.
- Production build and desktop/mobile QA pass with no console errors or mobile overflow.

## 2026-07-01 — Student Content Hub Completed

- Added the post-login/guest hub at `#/hub`.
- Login, successful registration, and enabled Guest access now converge on the hub.
- Added personalised greeting for student sessions and a Guest greeting for anonymous access.
- Added scalable circular Module A/B/C navigation. Module A opens the complete English Grammar & Composition library; Modules B and C display coming-soon status pending the next milestone.
- Added live progress summary from the existing grammar progress store: explored chapters, completed chapters, answered questions, completion percentage, and continue-where-you-left-off.
- Added functional sign-out and public-site return.
- Saved the user-approved reference at `design/concepts/student-hub-reference.png`.
- Production build and desktop/mobile QA pass: all three entry paths, Module A navigation, personalisation, progress display, sign-out, console health, and mobile overflow.

## 2026-07-01 — Module B and C Placeholder Pages Completed

- Added reusable coming-soon pages at `#/module/b` and `#/module/c`.
- Connected the Module B and Module C cards in the Student Content Hub to their respective pages.
- Matched the established parchment, maroon, and gold visual system with responsive layouts for desktop and mobile.
- Added working actions to return to the Learning Modules hub or open the completed Module A grammar library.
- Production build passes.
- Desktop/mobile QA passed: both module routes, hub return, Module A handoff, console health, and mobile overflow.
- This completes Step 4 only. The broader application still requires production backend/API/database services, secure authentication and email OTP delivery, security hardening, deployment configuration, and final end-to-end acceptance testing.

## 2026-07-01 — Answer-Grading Accuracy Fix

- Reviewed the user's submitted response for Volume I, Chapter 12, Exercise 12, Question 44.
- Confirmed that the former 85% whole-passage similarity rule incorrectly marked the response as correct despite tense, spelling, infinitive, and meaning errors.
- Replaced broad character-similarity grading with stricter significant-word matching.
- Harmless case, punctuation, spacing, and passage word-order variations remain acceptable; changed articles, tense, spelling, verb forms, omitted required words, and changed meaning are rejected.
- Corrected alternative-answer parsing so ordinary grammatical uses of `or` are no longer mistaken for separate acceptable answers.
- Added six automated regression tests, including the user's exact submitted passage.
- Automated tests and the production build pass.
- Rendered QA on Question 44 confirms that the submitted passage now displays `Review Answer`, while the model answer displays `Correct`; no console warnings or errors were found.

## 2026-07-04 — Step 5 Backend API and PostgreSQL Foundation Completed

- Added a TypeScript/Express 5 REST API under `server/` with request IDs, JSON error contracts, origin allow-listing, security headers, bounded request bodies, connection pooling, and environment validation.
- Added safe public endpoints for service health, Guest Login availability, and the content-module catalogue.
- Added a PostgreSQL migration runner with checksums, advisory locking, per-migration transactions, and idempotent re-runs.
- Added the initial relational schema for users, student profiles, schools, email-verification challenges, sessions, content modules, platform settings, chapter progress, question progress, audit events, and migration history.
- Added constraints, foreign keys, timestamp triggers, case-insensitive email uniqueness, seeded Modules A/B/C, and 30 indexes covering foreign keys and primary query paths.
- Connected the Landing Page and Student Content Hub to the safe public API with validated responses and graceful local fallback when the backend is unavailable.
- Kept all student/admin write endpoints closed until authenticated identities are implemented in Step 6.
- Added five API tests. Combined frontend/API verification now contains 11 passing tests.
- TypeScript checks and production builds pass for both the frontend and API.
- Live PostgreSQL 18 validation passed in an isolated temporary cluster: migration applied, repeat migration reported already applied, 11 schema tables and 3 seeded modules were confirmed, and the real PostgreSQL repository returned the expected public data.
- Rendered browser QA passed for Landing Page ? Guest Access ? Student Content Hub with correct module links and no console warnings/errors. The in-app browser accessibility snapshot API failed internally, so targeted DOM reads, screenshots, console inspection, and real link interaction were used instead.
- Production database credentials and the permanent managed database remain deployment configuration tasks; no credentials were stored in the repository.

## 2026-07-04 — Step 6 Secure Authentication Completed

- Finished the partially implemented authentication milestone and replaced the student and administrator demo-password flows with the real API.
- Added two-step student registration: validated profile submission, Argon2id password hashing, cryptographically generated six-digit email codes, HMAC-hashed code storage, expiry/attempt limits, and transactional account activation.
- Added student and administrator login with role enforcement, timing-safe generic credential failures, and a constant-work dummy-password path for unknown accounts.
- Added opaque 256-bit sessions stored only as SHA-256 hashes. Browsers receive HttpOnly, SameSite cookies; production uses Secure `__Host-` cookies.
- Added authenticated session lookup and logout. The student hub now personalises from the server session, and the administrator dashboard now verifies an administrator role instead of trusting session storage.
- Added origin enforcement, no-store authentication responses, bounded payload validation, and per-address throttling for authentication endpoints.
- Added SMTP email delivery for production and console delivery for local development. Production configuration rejects console-email mode.
- Added `npm run admin:create` for securely creating or rotating the first administrator without committing credentials or silently promoting a student.
- Added three authentication integration tests covering registration/OTP/session/logout, generic role-aware login failures, and rate limiting. The combined suite now has 14 tests.
- TypeScript checks, the 14-test combined suite, and the production frontend/API build pass. The managed sandbox blocks helper processes used by `tsx`/esbuild with `spawn EPERM`, so those commands were verified with the approved unsandboxed execution path.
- Live PostgreSQL 18 QA passed in an isolated temporary cluster: both migrations applied, repeat migration was idempotent, OTP consumption and hashed sessions persisted, one active student and one active administrator were confirmed, and the administrator bootstrap command worked.
- Rendered browser QA passed on desktop and mobile: real registration, console-email OTP verification, personalised student hub, cross-role administrator guard, administrator login, responsive layout, and console health. The Browser snapshot method failed internally, so targeted DOM reads, screenshots, and real interactions were used.
- Remaining after Step 6: live SMTP-provider acceptance, password recovery, persistent administrator CRUD/settings APIs, signed-in progress synchronization, deployment configuration, and final end-to-end acceptance testing.

## 2026-07-04 — Step 7 Persistent Administration Services Completed

- Replaced all hard-coded administrator summary, student, module, and Guest Login data with role-protected PostgreSQL APIs.
- Added a bounded administrator dashboard endpoint with server-side student search, account-status filtering, 25-row default limits, and opaque keyset cursors ordered by account creation time and ID.
- Added transactional Guest Login updates plus content-module create, update, and archive endpoints. Every successful mutation writes an audit event in the same database transaction.
- Protected Module A from archival through either the archive endpoint or a status update. Module codes and route slugs remain unique and all write payloads are validated.
- Added migration `003_administration_services.sql` with focused indexes for student status/creation queries, 30-day session and question activity, and module ordering.
- Rebuilt the administrator dashboard around persistent data: live summary counts, student filtering, empty states, Guest Login switching, a module editor, archived-state handling, usage totals, and server error/status feedback.
- Added stable malformed-JSON handling after live QA exposed a parser-order defect. Invalid JSON now returns `400 MALFORMED_JSON` with the same request ID in the header and response body.
- Added two API regression cases for administrator authorization/mutations and malformed JSON. The combined suite now contains 16 passing tests.
- TypeScript checks and the production frontend/API build pass.
- Live PostgreSQL 18 QA passed in an isolated cluster: all three migrations applied and re-ran idempotently; Guest Login and a new Module D survived reloads; two audit rows and all four Step 7 indexes were confirmed directly.
- Rendered QA passed for administrator login, real dashboard totals, student search, Guest Login persistence, module creation persistence, desktop layout, and a 390x844 mobile viewport with no horizontal overflow or console errors.
- The in-app Browser verified the mutation flows but timed out after an API hot restart. The documented installed-Chrome Playwright fallback completed the student-ledger and mobile checks.
- Remaining after Step 7: password recovery, administrator student-account actions, audit-log UI, signed-in progress synchronization, live SMTP-provider acceptance, deployment configuration, and final end-to-end acceptance testing.
